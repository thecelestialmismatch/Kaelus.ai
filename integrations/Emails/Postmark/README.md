# Hound Shield + Postmark

**One-line integration:** point your Postmark AI calls at the Hound Shield proxy URL.

## Setup

```bash
HOUNDSHIELD_PROXY_URL=https://your-tenant.houndshield.com/proxy
```

## How It Works

1. Change your AI endpoint base URL to `HOUNDSHIELD_PROXY_URL`
2. All prompts are intercepted and scanned (<10ms latency)
3. Violations are blocked before they leave your network
4. Compliance evidence is logged automatically (SOC 2 · HIPAA · CMMC Level 2)
