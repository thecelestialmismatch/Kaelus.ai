## CRITICAL REMINDERS

- **NEVER deploy to Vercel without user saying "deploy"** — always show files, ask Y/N
- Run `npm run build` before declaring any gap done
- Git identity: `git config user.email` = thecelestialmismatch@gmail.com
- Env vars are EMPTY — check before assuming anything works
- Dashboard = dark theme `bg-[#07070b]` | Marketing = light `bg-surface` | Brand = BLUE `brand-500 = #3B82F6`
- WebSocket = Docker only. Vercel = SSE only.
