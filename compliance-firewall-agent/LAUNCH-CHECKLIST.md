2. **Supabase migrations 003+004** — Run `npx supabase db push` to apply to production DB
3. **Cookie consent banner** — Required for GDPR compliance (EU users)
4. **SPF/DKIM/DMARC** — Email deliverability for confirmation/welcome emails
5. **Stripe webhook E2E test** — Confirm invoice.paid → subscription upgrade flow works
